### How do I leave a group if the "Leave Group" button is not visible?

Users may choose to leave a group for a variety of reasons, such as choosing to collaborate with different classmates. However, the user may notice that on some groups, the "Leave Group" button will not be visible under the "Action" column.

If no “Leave Group” button is available in the “Action” column, users must contact their instructor to be manually removed from the group.
