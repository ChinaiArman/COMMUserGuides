# Creating a Discussion Post

## Overview

This section will outline the steps needed to create a new discussion post. Students are able to create new threads or posts on discussion topics, which are created by the course instructor. While users are able to add images, formatting, and styling to their discussion posts, this user guide will only cover the steps to create a basic discussion post.

## Navigate to Class Homepage

Starting from the LearningHub homepage, users will need to navigate to the appropriate class’s homepage in order to submit an assignment.

3. **Scroll** on the page to find the specified discussion and **Click** on the discussion topic’s name.  

   !!! note
      Instructors are able to set close dates on discussion topics. Users must confirm that the discussion topic is still open for new discussions by checking the “Available until…” text directly below the discussion topic’s title to confirm that the date has not passed. If no text is below the discussion topic’s title, the discussion does not have a close date.
