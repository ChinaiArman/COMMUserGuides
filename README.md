## Objective

Create a user guide that describes how to complete basic LearningHub tasks. 
The guide features comprehensive instructions to complete 3 common tasks, as well as a troubleshooting and glossary section. One of the core aspects of this user guide is its usability. The guide includes images with each step, as well as headings to separate each section clearly. 

### Technologies Used:

* Markdown
* MkDocs
* VSCode
* Git

### `Skills Used`

* Communication: Communicating information is the core purpose of user guides. The guide challenged us to determine when information should be delivered, and what pieces were relevant to the user. To do this, we had to step into the mind of the reader, and think about what information they would need to successfully complete these tasks.
* Documentation: Layout and design are critical to strong documentation. Having an intuitive layout allows users to quickly find the information they need. A design that is aesthetic makes the guide easier to parse and a more enjoyable user experience. Incorperating this into our documentation was critical to making a strong guide and user experience.
* Attention to detail: The details matter when creating a user guide. Users can get stuck and easily confused from little details, especially when trouble shooting. Creating this user guide required us to pay exceptional attention to the details of the LearningHub interface.

### `What is Markdown?`

Markdown is a markup language enabling its users to quickly format text and create simple, non responsive webpages. 

### `What is LearningHub?`

LearningHub is an educational platform used to deliver online educational content to students. It is provided by the Brightspace ecosystem, and can be customized to each educational instutions needs.

### `User Testing`

After completing the user guide, we let a small sample of users demo our guide to find any holes in information or places that could use touchups. This process revealed flaws in our guide, particularly with the notes we added, as they often did not provide enough detail or have a supporting image. This was quickly fixed thanks to the user testing.
